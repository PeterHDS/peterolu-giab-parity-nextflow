# Evidence

This folder contains example outputs that show the pipeline running end-to-end.

- `local/`
  - Example BAM files and VCF stats from a complete local run on the tiny demo dataset.
  - MultiQC outputs (HTML/data) when available.
- `aws/`
  - Slots for future AWS Batch / Fargate reports and timelines.

These files back up the story in the main README about correctness and portability.
